Not sure it works this way for crossed mechanisms, but work for four-bar mechanisms.
- Make all lines equal length (this represents link #3)
- Identify the sides:
  - Label one end as side A (positions A1, A2, A3)
  - Label other end as side B (positions B1, B2, B3)
- Connect the positions:
  - Draw lines connecting A1 to A2, and A2 to A3
  - Draw lines connecting B1 to B2, and B2 to B3
- Find pivot points:
  - Find midpoint of A1-A2 line, draw perpendicular line from it
  - Find midpoint of A2-A3 line, draw perpendicular line from it
  - Repeat for B side (B1-B2 and B2-B3)
  - Find convergence points of perpendicular lines - these become your base pivot points
- Create the mechanism:
  - Connect convergence points to form the base (link #1)
  - Create links #2 and #4 from pivot points to the moving part
- The mechanism will now follow the desired path through all three positions
- All other parameters are calculated automatically.
